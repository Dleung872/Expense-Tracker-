# Key features
Key features of our expense tracker includes:

- The option to calculate total expenses
- An interactive menu to bridge key features.

  # Challenges
Challenges we faced while working on this project:
1. Communication - Our group was unable to work next to each other, being more spread out across the room, which makes it more difficult to come in contact with each other, limiting our communication. Outside of school, we don't have each other's contacts other than Daniel and Max, which also limits communication on the project outside of school as well. We were able to overcome the problem by finishing the project role by role, giving each of us independant control, Daniel started with adding, than handed it down to Aaron, than Max.
2. Skill level and Coding styles - Every member of the group has different ways of coding, causing some conflicts as we struggle to adapt and understand each others code, with difficulty communicating, linking all of our code together becomes a challenge. All of us are also at different levels in our coding journey, with some of us being more experienced than others. When working as a group, people with less experience needs more time, which can slow down our pace to finishing the project. We overcame our understanding challenge by enhancing the quality of our explainations, so everyone can understand the code more easily.

Our group semi-enjoys collaborative coding.  We enjoy the aspect of having more people to work on the project, as it boosts effieceny, and splits the work load significantly. However, we struggle with the fact that strong communication is needed to work on the program more efficiently, as well as a higher quality project.
